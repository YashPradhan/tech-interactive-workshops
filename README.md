# #include Tech Interactive Workshops 

## Purpose

These tech interactive workshops serve as activities for cohort members to do **after** finishing the corresponding week's lesson workshop. 

The interactive workshops should be done in **pairs** or **groups**.

Each interactive workshop corresponds to the topic of the lesson workshop so it allows members to **apply** the lesson they just learned.
